The Simon Game Project is made using HTML,CSS and Advanced Javascript which mainly focuses on using JQuery Library.

To beat the Simon game, players need to remember the color pattern and repeat it by pressing the colored buttons on the game unit in the correct order. It starts off at a rather steady pace, but the more you play, the more complicated the patterns become, building suspense with each turn.
Do let me know your highscores after playing the game :)
